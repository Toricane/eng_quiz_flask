# English Quiz

I built a quiz web app using Flask which quizzes the user on a list of English words. This was created for my classmates to practice!

1. **Spelling Quiz**: The user is given a definition and must type the correct word.
2. **Definition Quiz**: The user is given a word and must type the correct definition.

    - Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model is used to assess whether the user's provided definition is close enough to the actual definition.

3. **Sentence Creation Quiz**: The user is given a word and must create a sentence using the word.
    - Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model is used to assess whether the user's provided sentence properly uses the word.
